# BarChartTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

## TODOS

This app was built without using a chart library or any other external library on purpose as a challenge. I would do a few things differently given more time. I would make the table sticky and have some of the fields be links as there is a link provided. I would have the table be scrollable with a sticky header as the page can get really quite long where you are far from the header. I would either use a chat library or finesse the chart a bit more to have it scale better. I would rename some of the components to be better named as I started not fully understanding the type of data I was consuming and displaying. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
